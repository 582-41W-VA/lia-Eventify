# Request for Proposal (RFP)

## **Client Name**
EventPro Inc.

## **Organization Description**
EventPro Inc. is a leading organization specializing in event planning and management. We work with businesses, individuals, and organizations to create seamless event experiences, from corporate conferences to private celebrations. Our mission is to simplify the planning process, empower users with powerful tools, and foster community connections through well-organized events.

## **Problem Statement**
EventPro Inc. currently lacks a centralized platform where users can efficiently create, manage, and discover events. Our existing processes rely heavily on fragmented tools such as spreadsheets, emails, and phone calls, which are time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. These challenges have resulted in missed opportunities to engage with our audience, leading to reduced customer satisfaction and increased operational costs.
