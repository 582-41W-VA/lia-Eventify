## Project Overview:

The Eventify platform will allow users to easily create, manage, and discover events. Admins will have control over content and users, while regular users will be able to engage with the platform by adding events to their private collections, commenting on events, and exploring events through filtering, sorting, and search options. The site will be designed and built using Django and Python, with minimal use of JavaScript.
