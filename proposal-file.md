## Technologies Used

Eventify will be developed using the following technologies:

- **Django (Python)**: The backbone of the backend functionality, Django allows for efficient handling of requests, views, models, and templates. Its built-in features, such as the authentication system, make it ideal for this project.
- **SQLite**: Chosen for its lightweight nature, SQLite provides a simple yet powerful database solution that requires minimal setup and is easy to manage, making it a suitable choice for Eventify.
- **Django Authentication System**: Handles all user authentication processes, ensuring that users can securely log in, register, and manage their profiles.
- **Django Admin Panel**: Customized to suit the needs of Eventify, the admin panel provides a user-friendly interface for managing users, events, and comments, along with essential moderation and reporting tools.
- **Django Templates**: Used to render HTML for user-facing pages, templates ensure that the site's look and feel are consistent and can be easily updated when necessary.
- **Third-Party API Integration**: Used to fetch and import event data from trusted sources, ensuring Eventify is always up to date with a diverse array of events.
