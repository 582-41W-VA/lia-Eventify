## Technologies Used

Eventify will be developed using the following technologies:

- **Django (Python)**: Django will serve as the primary framework for both the front-end and back-end, providing server-side functionality and HTML templating. All interactivity, including search, filter, and user management, will be handled through Django forms, views, and server-side logic.
- **SQLite**: The application will use SQLite, which is Djangoâ€™s default database option, for simplicity and ease of development.
- **HTML/CSS**: Custom styles will be used for the responsive and attractive design, avoiding front-end frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma.
